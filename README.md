# IrisDatasetProcessor
A script processing and gathering statistical data from Fisher's Iris data set file.  
This is an import of a script I wrote some time ago when I was learning statistics and basic Python programming.  
  
Execute the script to print statistics related to each component of each flower species and to plot charts showing dependencies of a component's width and height.
